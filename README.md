# GANS Data Engineering Project

## Project Goal
This project was done as part of a data science bootcamp for a fictional company called "Gans".
Gans is a provider of electric scooters for rent.
For their business they want to know data about certain cities: population, weather-data and potential customers arriving via airplane.

So the task is to create an accessible database to provide them with up-to-date insights to these topics.
I personally expanded the goals of the project by also setting up a basic demand-"model" and an online-dashboard.

## Some results
